# 0x01. Basic authentication
***

     __Background Context__

     In this project, I will learn what the authentication process means and implement a Basic Authentication on a simple API.

     In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: Flask-HTTPAuth). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.


    __Resources__

    REST API Authentication Mechanisms
    Base64 in Python
    HTTP header Authorization
    Flask
    Base64 - concept

    __Learning Objectives__

    At the end of this project, be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    What authentication means
    What Base64 is
    How to encode a string in Base64
    What Basic authentication means
    How to send the Authorization header
