# 0x02. Session authentication
***

     __Background Context__

     In this project, I will implement a Session Authentication. I am not allowed to install any other module.

     In the industry, I should not implement my own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for me (like in Python-Flask: Flask-HTTPAuth). Here, for the learning purpose, I will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.



    __Resources__

    REST API Authentication Mechanisms - Only the session auth part
    HTTP Cookie
    Flask
    Flask Cookie



    __Learning Objectives__

    At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    What authentication means
    What session authentication means
    What Cookies are
    How to send Cookies
    How to parse Cookies
